Dear {{center_name}} user,

Your allocation for access has expired. Any accounts under this allocation are now unable to
access this resource. If you wish to continue using it, the group owner responsible for this project must create a new
allocation request. {{project_url}}

To create a new allocation request, login to ColdFront and complete the short process for the following project(s): 

{% for project_key, project_url in project_dict.items %}{{project_key}}: {{ project_url }} has the following allocations expiring soon:
    {% spaceless %} {% for allocation_key, allocation_value in allocation_dict.items %}{% if allocation_key == project_url %}{% for allocation in allocation_value %}{% for allocation_url, resource_name in allocation.items %}

    {{ resource_name }}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}

{% endfor %}

The group owner responsible for this project is required to renew it on a yearly basis. If you have not done so in the
last year, you will be required to before requesting a new allocation.
For more information about the yearly renewal, visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url }}.

If you are a student or collaborator under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy. If you would like
to opt out of future notifications, instructions can be found here: {{ opt_out_instruction_url }}

Thank you,
